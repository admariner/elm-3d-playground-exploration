# Elm 3D Playground Exploration

Welcome to Elm 3D Playground Exploration, an experimental playground created for game development using [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/). This project is a modification of [evancz/elm-playground](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/evancz/elm-playground/latest/). Here, `elm/svg` is replaced by [ianmackenzie/elm-3d-scene](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/ianmackenzie/elm-3d-scene/latest/).

You can preview examples of what this playground can do by [clicking here](https://erkal.github.io/elm-3d-playground-exploration/WebPage/index.html).

## Development Setup

To begin with the development setup, follow the steps listed below:

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/erkal/elm-3d-playground-exploration.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

```bash
cd elm-3d-playground-exploration
```

3. **Install Node.js:**

If you haven't installed Node.js yet, you can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

4. **Install all dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

5. **Run a development server:**
